# News-Parser

=======
Jan-28: scalability problem has been addressed. The webView is now scaled to fit within the device frame width.

Jan-24: This app pulls a list of news articles from a public API, then displays a list in a table with Titles. When one of the cells is selected, push to a more detailed view of that item in this case, a webview. 

The final project is shared in Thinh Le's public GitHub.
